# Seaweed Based Bioplastics: Data Mining Ingredient-Property Relations from Scientific Literature

**Overview:**
This project focuses on exploring the relationships between ingredients and properties in scientific literature related to seaweed-based bioplastics. By employing Data Mining techniques and unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, we aim to accelerate the identification and development of new materials.

**Data:**
We have gathered 2000 abstracts of scientific articles on seaweed bioplastics, along with a Bag of Words representation for ingredient classification, conditions, and properties. These data have been used to train and validate analysis models.

**Python Folder:**
In this folder, you will find Python code files, including data preprocessing, co-occurrence matrix analysis for ingredient-property and ingredient-ingredient relationships. It also details experiments conducted, including the use of the MatBERT model and different combinations of Bag of Words data in various processing approaches.

**References:**
The codes were developed by Thulasi Bikku (PhD in Computer Science) and Fernanda VÃ©liz (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science).
