# Seaweed-Based Bioplastics: Data Mining Ingredient-Property Relations from Scientific Literature

## Overview
This project explores relationships between ingredients and properties in seaweed-based bioplastics using data mining and unsupervised NLP models. The goal is to accelerate the identification and development of new materials.

## Data
We gathered 2000 abstracts on seaweed bioplastics and created a Bag of Words (BoW) representation for ingredients, conditions, and properties. These data are used to train and validate our models.

## Python Folder
Contains scripts for:
- `cooccurence_ing_vs_prop.ipynb`: Co-occurrence matrix analysis (ingredient-property and ingredient-ingredient relationships).
- `reshaped_ing_vs_ing_matrix.ipynb`: Bayesian classification to identify the most relevant features from the co-occurrence matrix.
- `Matbert.ipynb`: Experiments with MatBERT and various BoW data processing approaches.

## Compound Categories
- **Compound1**: List of all polysaccharides
- **Compound2**: List of all additives (organic and inorganic)
- **Compound3**: List of all plasticizer materials

## Sentence Analysis
The film generated by mixtures {Compound1} and {Compound2}. By adding {Compound3}, [MASK] in their water vapor permeability.

This image shows the best-scoring combinations using MatBERT: the first column is the compound (Compound1), the second is additives (Compound2), and the third is the best plasticizer (Compound3).
